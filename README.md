## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS (Preprocessor)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

SASS/SCSS makes creating custom CSS properties a whole lot easier, including nesting!

I plan on adding partials and modules to refactor the single SCSS style sheet.

### Continued development

Developing projects within a mobile-first environment would be something that I could benefit from, alongside any future teammates I'll be working with.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
